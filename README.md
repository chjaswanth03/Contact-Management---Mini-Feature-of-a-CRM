Contact Management - Mini Feature of a CRM
Project Overview
This Contact Management System is a simple web application developed as a mini feature of a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. The application allows users to add, view, edit, and delete customer contact information. It is built using the following technologies:

Frontend: ReactJS, Material UI (MUI), Axios
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (or any database you prefer)
State Management: React useState, useEffect
Features
Add New Contacts: Allows users to add a new contact with essential details like First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone Number, Company, and Job Title.
View Contacts: Displays contacts in a table format with pagination and sorting options for efficient browsing.
Edit Contacts: Users can update existing contact details.
Delete Contacts: Users can remove outdated or duplicate contacts from the system.
Technologies Used
Frontend: ReactJS, Material UI (MUI)
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (alternatively MySQL/PostgreSQL)
API: RESTful API using Express
State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine (v14 or above).
MongoDB: You can either use a local instance of MongoDB or a cloud database (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-management.git
cd contact-management
2. Install Dependencies
Frontend (ReactJS):
Navigate to the client directory (or the directory containing your React app) and install dependencies:

cd client
npm install
Backend (NodeJS):
Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

cd server
npm install
3. Database Setup
For MongoDB:

Install MongoDB locally or set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
Replace the MongoDB connection string in server/config/db.js (or wherever the DB connection is configured).
For MySQL/PostgreSQL:

If using another database, modify the database connection logic accordingly.
Running the Application
Start the Backend (Node.js): Navigate to the server directory and run:

npm start
This will start the backend server at http://localhost:5000.

Start the Frontend (React): Navigate to the client directory and run:

npm start
This will start the frontend server at http://localhost:3000.

Once both servers are running, the application should be live at http://localhost:3000, and it will interact with the backend at http://localhost:5000.

Database Schema (For MongoDB)
The following is the MongoDB schema for storing contact details:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const contactSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  lastName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
  },
  phone: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  company: {
    type: String,
  },
  jobTitle: {
    type: String,
  }
});

const Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', contactSchema);

module.exports = Contact;
API Endpoints
GET /contacts: Fetch all contacts
POST /contacts: Add a new contact
PUT /contacts/
: Update a contact's information
DELETE /contacts/
: Delete a contact
Challenges and Solutions
1. Handling Asynchronous Operations with Axios:
Challenge: While communicating between the frontend and backend, managing asynchronous operations with Axios was tricky at first, especially handling errors effectively.
Solution: Used async/await syntax with try/catch blocks in all Axios requests to handle errors gracefully and ensure smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
2. Managing State in React:
Challenge: Managing state effectively across different components, especially when dealing with forms and the contacts table.
Solution: Used React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and re-render the components efficiently when data was updated or fetched from the backend.
3. Database Integration:
Challenge: Initially, connecting the backend to the MongoDB database was a bit tricky as I had to set up the correct environment variables and database configurations.
Solution: Leveraged Mongoose to handle schema-based data modeling and MongoDB queries. Additionally, used MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage to avoid any local setup issues.
Future Improvements
Authentication: Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can manage contacts.
Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to filter contacts by name, company, or job title.
Contact Grouping: Allow users to categorize contacts (e.g., by region, industry, etc.).
